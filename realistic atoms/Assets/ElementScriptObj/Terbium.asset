  description: 'Terbium is a chemical element with the symbol Tb and atomic number
    65. It is a silvery-white, rare earth metal that is malleable, and ductile. The
    ninth member of the lanthanide series, terbium is a fairly electropositive metal
    that reacts with water, evolving hydrogen gas. Terbium is never found in nature
    as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite,
    monazite, xenotime and euxenite.  Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered
    terbium as a chemical element in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in yttrium
    oxide, Y2O3. Yttrium and terbium, as well as erbium and ytterbium, are named
    after the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form
    until the advent of ion exchange techniques.  '
